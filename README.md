I'll hopefully add more content and information soon - for now though, this
repository just contains the source code and schematics for the demos I showed
in my YouTube video here:

* https://youtu.be/XPLPTlAPOVA

# Source code

The demo source is in the src folder and can be compiled through the Makefile, or
by running something like:

    vasm.vasm6502-oldstyle -Fbin -dotdir src/snake.s -o bin/snake.out

# Hardware schematics

Please see the [hardware] folder for schematics, BOM, and build notes.

# Feedback

Do let me know on reddit (/u/gfoot360) if you have any comments, questions, requests, or other feedback!
